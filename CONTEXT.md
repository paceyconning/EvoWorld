# EvoWorld Project Context File

*Living document for AI agent development assistance*

## 🎯 Project Vision

**EvoWorld** is a **single-user, persistent simulation** where the user acts as a **passive observer**, witnessing the **autonomous evolution** of humanoid lifeforms. The simulation runs continuously, driven by **AI-driven emergent behavior**, **environmental challenges**, and **internal social dynamics**.
