# EvoWorld: Autonomous Civilization Evolution Simulation

**Tagline**: *Watch as humanoids rise from survival to sentience â€“ a world that evolves without your hand, rendered in stunning detail with creative viewing modes.*

## Vision

EvoWorld is a **single-user, persistent simulation** where the user acts as a **passive observer**, witnessing the **autonomous evolution** of humanoid lifeforms. The simulation runs continuously, driven by **AI-driven emergent behavior**, **environmental challenges**, and **internal social dynamics**.

## Core Features

### 1. Autonomous Evolution
- **No Direct Control**: The user does **not intervene** in the simulation
- **Exponential Growth**: Humanoids adapt through stages of survival, social organization, and technological innovation
- **Emergent Storytelling**: Unique narratives generated through AI-driven behavior and environmental randomness

### 2. Detailed, Immersive Graphics
- **Dynamic, Stylized Environments**: Procedurally generated worlds with realistic terrain, dynamic weather, and evolving ecosystems
- **Humanoid Characters**: Highly detailed 3D models with facial animations, body language, and AI-driven behavior
- **Creative Viewing Modes**: 
  - **Overview Map**: Top-down, stylized map showing civilization spread and resource distribution
  - **Close-Up Mode**: Zoom into individual humanoids or small groups
  - **Timeline View**: Chronological view of major events
  - **Spectator Camera**: Free-roaming camera capturing emergent moments

### 3. Observation Tools
- **Data Analytics Panel**: Evolution metrics, population growth, technological milestones
- **AI Behavior Logs**: Key decisions made by the civilization
- **Environmental Impact Tracker**: Map showing environmental changes over time

## Architecture

### Backend (Rust)
- **Simulation Engine**: Core autonomous AI-driven behavior system
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL for persistent world state and event logging
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication with frontend
- **Analytics Engine**: Evolution metrics and reporting

### Frontend (Godot 4)
- **3D World Renderer**: Multiple viewing modes with stylized graphics
- **UI System**: Data panels, controls, and observation tools
- **WebSocket Client**: Real-time data streaming from backend

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Rust** (latest stable version)
2. **PostgreSQL** (12 or later)
3. **Godot 4.2** (for frontend development)
4. **Git**

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EvoWorld
   ```

2. **Set up PostgreSQL**:
   ```bash
   # Create database and user
   sudo -u postgres psql
   CREATE DATABASE evoworld;
   CREATE USER evoworld WITH PASSWORD 'password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE evoworld TO evoworld;
   \q
   ```

3. **Configure the simulation**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Edit config.toml with your database credentials
   ```

4. **Build and run the simulation**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   cargo run --release
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Open Godot 4.2** and import the `frontend/` directory as a project

2. **Run the frontend**:
   - Open the project in Godot
