## Phase 1: Core Backend Systems âœ… COMPLETED

### Backend Server Milestones
- âœ… **Complete terrain generation** - Multi-scale noise, biomes, rivers, minerals, structures
- âœ… **Complete AI behavior trees** - Sophisticated decision-making with personality-driven behavior
- âœ… **Complete enhanced resource management** - Advanced spawning, environmental impact, competition, technology requirements
- âœ… **Basic simulation engine** - Tick-based world updates and state management
- âœ… **Resource system foundation** - Resource types, inventory, and sophisticated spawning
- âœ… **Event system** - Comprehensive logging and event management
- âœ… **Analytics engine** - Population tracking and evolution metrics
- âœ… **WebSocket server** - Real-time communication infrastructure
- âœ… **Database layer** - PostgreSQL integration with sqlx (temporarily disabled)

### Phase 1 Achievements
- **Terrain Generation System**: Complete procedural generation with realistic biomes, rivers, and structures
- **AI Behavior Tree System**: Sophisticated decision-making with personality-driven behavior and real-time condition evaluation
- **Enhanced Resource Management**: Advanced resource spawning with environmental impact, competition, and technology requirements
- **Core Simulation Infrastructure**: Robust foundation for complex world simulation

## Phase 2: Short-term Goals ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete WebSocket Communication** - Real-time client-server updates and event streaming
2. **Restore Database Functionality** - Re-enable sqlx queries with proper DATABASE_URL configuration
3. **Add Comprehensive Testing** - Expand unit tests and add integration tests
4. **Frontend Development** - Complete Godot 4 frontend implementation

### Phase 2 Milestones
- [ ] **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time world state updates and event streaming
- [ ] **Database Restoration** - Full persistence with optimized queries and schema
- [ ] **Testing Suite** - Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] **Frontend Foundation** - Basic 3D world rendering and UI
